# ConvoWeave-AI

A sophisticated conversational AI system demonstrating enterprise-level natural language processing capabilities. Built with modern transformer architectures, vector search, and advanced memory management for intelligent, context-aware conversations.

## Project Overview

ConvoWeave-AI is a production-ready chatbot system that showcases advanced AI engineering skills through the integration of multiple state-of-the-art models and techniques. The system weaves conversation history and knowledge into intelligent responses through dynamic personality adaptation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), persistent memory, and real-time sentiment analysis.

## Key Features

### Advanced AI Architecture
- **Multi-Model Integration**: Mistral-7B for natural language generation, RoBERTa for sentiment analysis, DistilRoBERTa for emotion detection
- **RAG System**: Semantic search with FAISS indexing and sentence-transformer embeddings
- **Dynamic Personalities**: Four distinct AI personalities (Professional, Friendly, Creative, Analytical) with adaptive trait modification
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Intelligent context injection from knowledge base and conversation history

### Sophisticated Memory System
- **Persistent Storage**: SQLite database for structured data, ChromaDB for vector embeddings
- **Semantic Memory**: Retrieval of relevant past conversations using cosine similarity
- **User Profiling**: Comprehensive user modeling with preference tracking and behavioral analysis
- **Memory Decay**: Intelligent forgetting mechanism for optimal context management

### Real-Time Analytics
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Multi-model sentiment detection with confidence scoring
- **Emotion Recognition**: 10+ emotion categories with intensity analysis
- **Conversation Insights**: Real-time analytics dashboard with interactive visualizations
- **Performance Monitoring**: System health metrics and response time tracking

### Professional Interface
- **Modern Web UI**: Glassmorphism design with responsive layout
- **Interactive Controls**: Personality selection, auto-adaptation toggles, system monitoring
- **Knowledge Management**: Dynamic knowledge base expansion capabilities
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live sentiment tracking and conversation analytics
